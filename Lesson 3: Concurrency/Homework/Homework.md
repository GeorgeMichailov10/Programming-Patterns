2. You need to perform a lot of calculations on large arrays.


3. You are building a real-time chat server that needs to handle thousands of simultaneous client connections. However, each connection is mostly idle, waiting for messages.


4. Training a computation heavy ML model.


5. Interacting with an external API, processing the data, and storing the results in a db.
