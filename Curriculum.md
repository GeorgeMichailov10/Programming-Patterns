# Overview

## Python

### Web Development (Beginner)
1. Web Dev with Mongo and Flask
2. Multiple Entities and User Auth in Flask

### Concurrency with Python
4. Concurrency with async vs threading vs processes
5. Mutexes, semaphores, and producer consumer problems

### Machine Learning Basics
6. Machine Learning Fundamentals of a Neural Net (Build from scratch, diagram)
7. Build micrograd by Andrej Karpathy
8. Build name predictor using neural nets (project day)
9. CNN on cats vs dogs and then the MNIST dataset for HW
10. Training techniques (Batch norm, grad clipping, fp precision, weight decay, learning rate scheduling, fused optimizer, kaiming weight initialization, hyperparameter tuning)
11. Transfer Learning (CIFAR with ResNet)

### Machine Learning Intermediate
12. Introduction to transformers (HEAVY EMPHASIS)
13. Impelementing a transformer model (MNIST during class, names dataset for homework)
14. LLM Fundamentals and concepts
15. Interacting with models from HuggingFace, LoRA Finetuning, quantization, vLLM
16. Basic GAN on MNIST

### Backend and Scaling
16. FastAPI, API Rate limiting and Security, Caching with Redis

## C++
24. Basic memory management, pointers, references
25. Advanced memory: Custom memory allocators (Pool, stack, arena collection), cache optimization, data-oriented design
26. Performance optimization and valgrind, move semantics
27. Concurrency in C++ (threads, fork, mutexes, semaphores)
28. Interprocess communication, boost
29. Socket Programming
30. Build Neural Net framework from scratch for cuda
