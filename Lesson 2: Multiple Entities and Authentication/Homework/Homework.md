You will write a simple Notes app where a user has notes and you will represent this relationship through reference, not embedding.
Additionally, you will implement login/registration with password hashing, JWT token creation, and route protection.

You will build the following routes
/login
/register
/note: Get, Create, Update, Delete notes (Be careful here)
/user: Get will return a list of the content of all the notes belonging to a user, Delete user (Be careful here)
